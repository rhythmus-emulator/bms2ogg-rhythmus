## A General Decoder / Encoder with mixing channels & effectors.

## Main Features
- Sound Decoding: supports ogg/flac/mp3/wav file
- Sound Encoding: Save mixing result to ogg/flac file.
- Sound mixing feature (e.g. BMS file)
- Passive Mixing: Mix chart file into PCM data at once.
- Active Mixing: Support sound output in real-time (usable with callback function)
- Effectors: Tempo / Pitch shifting.
- Real-time MIDI mixing supported (based on timidity - a little modified).

## TODO
- Add frequency effector.
- More easy-to-use mixing system.

## Notice
- To make midi sound, midi instrument file & configuration is necessary. You can get instruments from [freepats](https://github.com/feross/freepats).
